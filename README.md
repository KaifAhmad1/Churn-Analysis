# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## Objective
Analyzing and predicting customer churn in the telecommunication domain to implement proactive retention strategies.

## Workflow

### Data Preparation
1. Load and inspect dataset.
2. Handle missing values and drop unnecessary columns.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Visualize data distributions and relationships.
2. Explore feature impact on churn.

### Data Preprocessing
1. Convert categorical variables.
2. Split into features (X) and target (y).
3. Standardize numerical features.

### Model Development
1. Utilize ML algorithms:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Gradient Boosting Classifier
2. Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization.

### Model Evaluation
1. Assess model performance using metrics.
2. Compare and choose the most effective model.

### Visualization
1. Create visualizations for insights.
2. Utilize Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

### Insights
1. Derive actionable insights from EDA.
2. Understand factors influencing customer churn.

## Conclusion
